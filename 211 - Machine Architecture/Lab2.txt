Part 1
1. Machine language is written in 1's and 0's for the cpu to read directly while assembly language is a slightly higher level language that uses
numbers and symbols while still being lower level than other languages such as java.
2. RISC stands for reduced instruction set computer which implies the instruction set is very simple contains a small number of instructions.
3. Vonn neuman architecture uses a single shared memory bus and stores data and instructions in the same memory unit.
Harvard architecture uses two memory buses to read data and instructions seperately.
4. AVR uses modified harvard like most other devices as it is much quicker than vonn neuman or old harvard architecture.
5. PROGMEM is persistent flash memory thats usually the largest storage storing things like program code and/or data.
SRAM is very fast but volatile memory storing data and registers like global variables and methods.
EEPROM is persistent long term memory that is very slow and non-Volatile usually storing the BIOS code.
6.SRAM in an AVR starts at 0x0100
7. If you want to store a number during the execution of assembly code you would want 
to use the general purpose registers where variables are commonly stored
8. The ALU is connected to the general purpose registers so operands can be loaded directly to the ALU.
9. If the carry bit is set to 1 it implies the arithmatic overflowed
10. When using SUBI k can be 8 bits while the rd can only be 4 bits.

Part 2
regA = 7
regB = 31
regC = 42
regD = 1

add regA, regC = 7 + 42 = 49
regA = 49
regB = 31
regC = 42
regD = 1

adc regB, regD = 31 + 1 = 32
regA = 49
regB = 32
regC = 42
regD = 1

49 = 00110001   
32 = 00100000

00100000 00110001
8192 4096 2048 1024 512 256 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
8192 + 1 + 16 + 32 = 8241
