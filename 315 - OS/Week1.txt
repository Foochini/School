“Kernel” – Part of the OS that Is always present in memory
	-Manages resources (CPU, memory, devices, disks)
	-Abstracting the system
System Bus – Bunch of electronic connections(200ish)(wires)

CPU Registers
	-Program Counter (PC) - Stores the address of the next instruction
	-Instruction Register (IR)/(CIR) -Stores the instruction currently being executed
	-Memory address register (MAR) – Stores the address of a location in memory
-Memory Data Register (MDR) – Stores data that’s going / coming from a location in                                     memory (MAR)
-Accumulator (AC)/(ACC) – A registry that stores data or data that is the result of a calculation --- (Special Purpose Register)
	PC -> MAR -> MDR-> CIR -> Control Unit -> PC -> MAR -> AC
Intro To C
-Many statements are similar to java (Data types - int, long, byte, double, char, boolean)
	-Loops (similar to java), Cant declare variable inside FOR loop
	-Conditionals, Operators
	-No string datatype
	-Use int method MOST times so we make it clear where method ends

Hello World in C

#include <stdio.h>
Int main(){
	Printf(“Hello World!\n”);
Return 0;
}
Complilation -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$gcc hello.c       - Creates file a.out
$a.out 		-Runs script from command line
Hello World!
$gcc -o helloFile hello.c 	-Creates script called helloFile
$helloFile
Hello World!
$
