One time pad - substitution cipher thats substituted using a random set of numbers
    - Unbreakable if proper steps are followed
    -Key must be random, longer than the plain text and cannot be reused
    -Only way to decrypt is to brute force
    Cons
    -True random number generation is hard
    -Key must be same length as plain text so cannot memorise
    -Need secure side channel to exchange key

Truly random key can not be compressed
    -Entropy = randomness
    -Generating good quality entropy done using: 
        -Chaotic systems - very high quality entropy but slow
            -random generators use complex difficult to predict phenomenon
            -Example: Picture of a wall of lava lamps converted to bytes
            -Used Today: Generates entropy based on user inputs - time between key presses, mouse scroll, ...
        -Quantum effects - True randomness but slow
            -Most quality entropy 
            -Based on inherently unpredictable events such as radioactive decay
            -Quantum phenomenon are extremely slow - These are rarely used IRL
            -Electron passes through silicon and creates white noise - Extremely random but can be affected by external sources
            -Hotbits - true randomness audio
        -Thermal effects - easier to use but can be temperature dependent
            -Thermal noise in resistors / Atmospheric noise generated by things like lightning
            -Thermal effects are sub par because they can be influenced by temperature or external sources
        -Clock Drift
            -Relies on oscillators to drift in and out of accuracy
            -Small size and power consumtion makes them very popular
        Modern PC's use multiple different sources of entropy

        Pseudo-Random functions (PRNG)- Complex math - Produces NO Entropy

        Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator - (CSRNG) - Very quick
            -PRNG good enough to be cryptographically secure
            -Take a small smount of true entropy and use it as seed for a CSRNG
