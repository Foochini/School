Why we use Assymetric over symmetric - There is no secure channel of communcation you cant exchange key

Elliptic curve D-H (ECDH)
    -Both parties generate private key and run a shared common value through a curve function

NSA tried to make popular a broken Elliptical curve cryptography 

Ephemeral (ECDHE)
    -Generate fresh new keys for each interaction to create FORWARD SECRECY

TLS 
    -ECDHE allows two parties to establish a shared secret using the Diffie - Hellman style ke exchange
        -Problem: Cant verify who you are communicating with
    
    RSA - Encrypt something with a private key, then decrypt it using public key
        -This is the opposite of normal encryption. Used to "sign" things - Shows it hasnt been tampered with
        -Typical RSA private key length is 1024 bits - 2^1024 possible private keys
        -Public key is derived from public key

        -Server will have a certificate with a public key, issued by a verificastion company
        -Certificate is a voucher of authenticity

        1.Server sends a certificate along with ECDHE public key, which we verify
        2.Client sends public key and certificate to server and both parties calculate shared secret
        3.Switch to AES with shared secrety key  

Key Sizes - How long are keys in ECC or RSA or AES
    -Asymmetric cryptography rely on mathematically intractable problems which means they are hard to solve
        -Long ass keys basically

More TLS - Satisfies 3 important properties for security
    -Confidentiality - Encrypted and cannot be read by 3rd party
    -Authentication - Certificate proves your identity
    -Integrity - Protects against alteration of the message

Hashing Functions - Broad class of functions that take a variable length input and produce a fixed length output
    Properties of Hash function
        -Avalanche behaviour - Single bit change produces a large change
        -Uniform distribution - Produces an output range that is evenly distributed across all possible output ranges
        -Collision resistance - It is difficult to find different inputs that have the same input

Lets Encrypt - Non profit company that gives certificates (HTTPS)
