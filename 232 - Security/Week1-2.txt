CIA Triad – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
	-Can improve one trait but it will cost another trait
Confidentiality – Restrict access to sensitive information
Integrity – Protecting data from unauthorized tampering – “Can I trust this data?”
Availability – Making sure data is accessible to the end user – Very hard balancing with availability and integrity and confidentiality

Air Gapped – Machine with no connection to the internet – Affects availability and integrity
	-To be properly air gapped it should have never been connected to the internet
Different types of bad actors
1.Substantial number of security attacks are traced to organized crime

3.Politically motivated hackers or government sponsored hackers

Vulnerability – Weakness in the system
Zero day vulnerability – Unknown vulnerability that is discovered on “day zero”
	-Day zero is the day its found and a race begins to exploit and patch it
Most trusted algorithms are the ones that codebases are completely free to see online
