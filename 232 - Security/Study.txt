-CIA Triad and its components
    = Confidentiality
    = Integrity
    = Availability
    = When each component increases other components must decrease - Easy to access means less Confidentiality

-Bad actor - examples
    = Entity with malicious intent
    = Hacker / Cyber criminals

-Vulnerability - zero day vulnerability
    = A weakness in a system that can be exploited
    = Zero day vulnerability is the day the vulnerabiulity is made public theres is a race to patch / exploit it

-Difference between data in transit and data at rest
    = Data in transit - Data moving across networks , REQUIRING ENCRYPTION like TLS 
    = Data at rest - Data stored somewhere REQUIRING ENCRYPTION like AES

-Basic principles of Polyalphabetic and Ceaser ciphers
    -And the issue of frequency analysis in this context
    = Ceaser Cipher - Shift cipher that rotates letters by a fixed number 
    = Polyalphabetic cipher - Uses multiple alpabets to encrypt plaintext. MAKING FREQUENCY ANALYSIS HARDER
    = Frequency analysis - Can crack Ceaser cipher by finding the most frequent letters in english in cipher text
        =Polyalphabetic ciphers mitigate this by changing letter mappings

-One time pad (OTP) - properties of an OTP 
    = Uses truly random key as long as the message
    = If used correctly provides PERFECT SECRECY
    = Key must never be reused
    = NEED secure side channel to share key
    = CON - true random numbers very hard 

-Example of why entropy is important
    = High entropy means more randomness making decryption harder for bad actors

-Entropy sources - pros and cons of each
    = Chaotic Systems - Very high quality entropy but slow
        = Picture of wall of lava lamps
        = Used today - Generates entropy off the time between key presses or mouse moves
    = Quantum affects - True randomness but slow
        = Best entropy
        = Radioactive decay 
        = Very slow
    = Thermal effects - Easy and fast but temperature dependent and can be tampered with
        = Thermal noise in resistor / lightning
        = Can be tampered with by temp or outside sources
    = Clock Dift - Small size and power consumtion - Very popular

-Why are Pseudorandom number generators not truly random - How its useful in constructing other cryptography systems
    = PRNG's use algoithms to generate numbers so if given the same state at start same number will be given
    = Useful for cryptography but vulnerable if STATE is known

-Explain with diagrams how a stream cipher functions including inputs and outputs like key, plaintext and ciphertext
    = PRNG is used to create a keystream that is longer/equal than the plaintext and the two are XOR'd together
         key -> PRNG -> 0101010101010101010101  \
                                                  -> XOR -> CipherText    
           PlainText -> 1010101010101010101010  /

-Know what XOR operation does  - XOR = Exlusive Or
    = Outputs 1 if inputs differ and 0 if the same

-Explain relation between OTP and stream cipher - Why doesnt stream cipher meet requirements for an OTP
    = Stream cipher and OTP both encrypt bit by bit
    = Differ in key generation and usage
    = Stream cipher generates keystream off of FIXED key - Reused so less secure than OTP

-Difference between stream and block cipher
    = Stream cipher encypts bit by bit
    = Block cipher encrypts in fixed sized blocks (AES uses 128 bit blocks)

-Benefits of block cipher and why better than stream
    = MODERN STANDARD FOR ENCRYPTION - AES most popular block cipher 
    = Better security, very fast, extremely versatile - on modern hardware
    = Uses less memory
    = Less susceptible to bit - flipping attacks

-What is mode of operation and describe the 3, ECB, CBC, CTR
    = Mode of operation - An algorithm that block ciphers use to encrypt
    = ECB (Electronic codebook) - Splits plaintext into blocks and encrypts each seperately - Same key used for each so doesnt hide patterns
    = CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) - Combines encrypted ciphertext of the PREVIOUS BLOCK into the plaintext of next block
    = CTR (Counter mode) - Turns block cipher into stream cipher by encrypting incrementing counters

-explain block encryption function (Mixing function)
    = Mixing function - function that "stirs" inputs together
    = Mixing function should produce vastly different output if input altered slightly
    = Use multiple "rounds" so we ensure its properly mixed

-explain concepts of cryptographic primitives and examples (chacha20 mixing round)
    = Primitive - Cryptography building blocks (Example: Hash functions, ciphers)
    = Chacha20 mixing round  is considered a primitive because its a building block for the chacha20 algorithm

-Properties of a good mixing function
    = hard to determine input from the output - duh
    = Should utilize whole range of space it can - output should not have any more characters than any other
    = Sensitive - small change in input should be major change in output

-How and why DES was broken and what replaced It
    = Computers became faster and the 56 bit key is too easily brute forced
    = Replaced by AES - offering better security with longer key sizes

-Know what internal state grid of AES looks like
    = 4x4 byte matrix 

-Describe the 3 steps of the AES mixing round
    = SubBytes - each byte in the state matrix is replaced using a substitution box
    = ShiftRows - Each row of the state matrix is shifted left or right by different numbers
    = MixColumns - Linear transformation that mixes bytes within each column using matrix multiplication

-Explain how number of rounds is related to output key size
    = More rounds = stronger security by increasing diffusion
    = AES128 = 10 rounds
    = Longer key length requires more rounds to distribute entropy effectively

-Provide an argument for why you should use AES
    = Secure, efficient, widely used
    = Resistant to known cyber attacks

-Explain a side channel attack and why it may concern AES
    = Side channel attack - Not going after the algorith mbut the actual harware running it
    = Attacks analyze timing, power consumtion and other hardware information to try and extract keys
    = AES uses key dependent calculations meaning variations in execution time make it vulnerable to these attacks

-Why is padding necessary in block ciphers 
    = Blocks must be a fixed size so if smaller - Pad the block to make it right size

-Explain how zero padding works
    = Add zeros to make block size equal

-Identify both PKCS and ANSI standard padding , explain how they work and remove padding if requested
    = PKCS - Add padding with the value of the length of padding
        =Add 4 bytes onto message - each byte has value of 4
    = ANSI - Same as PKCS but only last byte has value of length
        =Add 4 bytes onto message - 3 bytes with value of zero and last byte is 4

-Problem of securing a side channel and why symmetric  crptography requrires a side channel
    = Symmetic cryptography needs a side channel to exchange keys
    = Side channel can be attacked - easier to attack than cipher

-What public and private keys are used for and how they are related
    = Private key only known to creator
    = Public key - mathematically derived from private key

-Describe / Diagram the Diffie- hellman exchange, including WHAT is transferred
    = Assymetric uses 2 keys 
    = Each party mixes their Private key with common starting values to produce PUBLIC KEY 
    = parties exchange PUBLIC KEYS
    = Each party mixes private key with public key and voila
    = Since private keys stay private NO NEED for a SECURE SIDE CHANNEL

    = Very slow but usually used to create a secure side channel to exchange a symmetric key

Salsa20 - Stream cipher using 256 bit key
ChaCha - Stream cipher using 512 bit key

ROT 13 - Ceaser cipher

XOR - Why its desirable
    =Very fast
    =Slef reversing - applying the same XOR operation twice returns the original
    =Truth table is a 50/50 split of 0/1 so the output is very uniform

STREAM CIPHER is not feasable for OTP because key is not TRULY random it uses PRNG
