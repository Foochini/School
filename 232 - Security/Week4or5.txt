Modern Standard - AES 
    -DES became obsolute
    -AES = Advancced encryption Standard
    -AES block size - 128 bits
    -AES almost everywhere - If connected to internet using AES encryption to connect 
    -Why use AES - Open sourced so very secure since everyones looked at it
        -It is fast for high speed encryption and decryption
    
Limitations of cryptanalysis attacks
    -Crpytanalysis attack on AES are theoretical
    -Billions of years to recover a single key
Side channel attacks
    -Doesnt try to manipulate or break AES attack the platform or hardware that the algorithms on
    -Cache timing attacks - analyzes the precise timing of a cryptographic system and uses differences in timing to determine the inputs

AES Is very Secure
