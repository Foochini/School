Plan Driven - All planning done upfront
    -Fixed scope / cost - predicatble - heavy documentation

    -SCRUM master - Facilitates the SCRUM
    -Development team - Delivers increments of the product

Product backlog - Prioritizes list of features
Sprint backlog - subset of product backlog chosen for each sprint 

XP - Extreme programming
    -User Story - As a user I want to reset my password
    -Pair programming - DRIVER writes code while NAVIGATOR reviews and gives suggestions
    -TDD - Write failing tests first then write code to pass the tests 
    -Refactoring - Improve code without altering its functionality

UML diagrams
Use case - Actors, use  cases, relationships
Sequence - Actors, objects, messages
Class diagram - Classes, attributes, methods, relationships
Activity - Models workflow with actions and decision points

Story point - Measure of effort and complexity
Planning poker - Everyone gets a card - they reveal their estimates - discuss and reach a consensus
